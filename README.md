==========

This is my Quadcopter project. It is based on a STM32F1 Discovery board.

This project is focused on making a quadcopter platform, that is not restricted to a RC controller and is easily expandable. It has to be cheap, small and most of all "hackable". A user can pickup this project and develop new functions for the platform.

The initial hardware is some basic 9DOF sensor from ebay and for communication awe use a NRF24L01. It should be easy to intergrate your ouwn controller.

Currently it is still development. 

Tasks:
* Drivers:
- I2C (Done, probably)
- SPI
- PWM
- TIMER
